# Sorting Arrays
## Points: 10

## Submission
`commit` and `push` your code to the `master` branch on the remote GitHub repository **before** the deadline.

## Clone
`clone` this repo to repl.it or your local machine using the link provided on the GitHub repo page.

Use the included files as your template to start the program maintaining the filenames given.

## Running in Repl.it
The "Run" button should be configured; however, **it is NOT required**. This button is a "luxury", but on the off chance it does not work, you MUST compile and run the program manually using `gcc` to compile. Lack of usability of the "Run" button is not an valid excuse for not completing the assignment.

## Description
For this assignment you need to make bubble sort algorithm that will sort an array. Do not copy an online program.

Please print your array before and after the sorting.

Perform the following tasks:
1. Print the **unsorted** array **before** you run the bubble sort algorithm
2. During the bubble sort, you must print out the entire **unsorted portion** of the array after each comparison (even if a swap was not encountered)
3. Print out the final **sorted** array **after** the bubble sort has completed

**HINT:** You will need to use nested loops to complete this algorithm, but I suggest starting with a single loop that goes through the list one time and does the comparisons and swaps for one pass through the data.

### Input file format
The input file will have the following format:
```
First line: Number of values in the input file for you to sort
Second+ Line(s): Values to add to your array
```

Example of an input files format:
```
10
50
78
83
92
100
0
4
72
3
19
```

**Sample input files are provided, please add your input to the `input.txt` file for testing in Repl.it**

### Requirements
* Use the given template and **filename** for your submission.
* You must use functions in an appropriate way
* Your program must read input from a file in the proper format, NOT stdin
* Your program should accept the filename from the command-line as shown in the example below
* Your format must match mine **exactly** (width of 3 with space for numbers)
* Your array should be sized dynamically using the size from the input file

#### Required Functions
```c
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int size);
void printArr(int arr[], int size);
```


### Example Output
```
$ ./a.out input.txt
